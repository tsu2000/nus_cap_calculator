# nus_cap_calculator

A simple web application that is geared toward students of NUS (National University of Singapore) that allows users to:
- Select NUS modules, view their current CAP and other details relating to selected modules, plus export the selected data to an Excel (.xlsx) file and allows module data to similarly be imported in the same format as the Excel file.
- Input data to predict their future CAP.
- View the sensitivity of their current CAP as a heatmap.
- View a detailed explanation of how CAP at NUS is calculated.

For non-NUS students, view the web app [**here**](<https://gpa-calc.streamlit.app>).
